# NotePad

NotePad is a simple android application that stores and displays notes created by a user.

It is to be built over the month of July, 2017. 

There are 4 main tasks listed as project 'issues'. Each of these are equivalent to a weekly 'sprint'. In which we'll work on building a component of the app together.

The merge process will be as such: 

  This will be Sprint 1 which will map to Issue 1 and so on. 

  This means that each of you should pull the project from the `develop` branch, create a local branch in the format of: 

    1-splash-yourname
    2-rv-yourname
    3-dialog-yourname
    4-db-yourname

Depending on what week we're in, and push that branch: `git push -u origin yourbranchname`, to the remote. Each student is to then make a pull request to `develop` and begin working on their local branch continually pushing to remote so that you update your pull request and others can comment on your code.


#### Week 1: Splash screen. 

We'll begin in simplicity to get the hang of working together. This week we will establish a system that will set the pace for the next month. 

This week your branch name will be: `1-splash-yourname.`

* You are all to work on making this feature complete, this means that you will all branch away from develop with the appropriate branch name, push this branch to the repo, open a pull request for this feature and from your local copy, push to your remote continually. You will work collectively to complete it. During class time we will discuss different approaches and work to complete a version that all of us are okay with.

* You will measure yourself by talking through these pull requests and updating your branches accordingly. Copy pasting will do you a disservice, the point is to investigate approaches individually, ask each other questions and come up with an efficient solution.

* At the end of Sunday night of class that week, the feature should be complete and the introducion and discussion of the next component should take place.

* If you have any questions about the feature, this can be addressed as a comment on the relevant issue.
