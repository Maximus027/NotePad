# NotePad

NotePad is a simple android application that stores and displays notes created by a user.

It is to be built over the month of July, 2017. 

There are 4 main tasks listed as project 'issues'. Each of these are equivalent to a weekly 'sprint'. In which we'll work on building a component of the app together.

##### Week 1: Splash screen. 

We'll begin in simplicity to get the hang of working together. This week we will establish a system that will set the pace for the next month. 

The merge process will be as such: 

This will be Sprint 1 which will map to Issue 1 and so on. 

This means that each of you should pull the project, create a branch in the format of: 

1-splash-yourname// 
2-rv-yourname
3-dialog-yourname
4-db-yourname

Depending on what week we're in:

This week it will be: `1-splash-yourname.`

You are all to work on making this feature complete, this means that you will all branch away from master with the appropriate branch name, push this branch to the repo, create and open a pull request for this feature and push continually as you collectively work together to complete it. During class time we will discuss different approaches and work to complete a version that all of us are okay with.   

You will measure yourself by talking through these pull requests and updating your branches. Copy pasting will do you a disservice, the point is to investigate approaches individually ask each other questions and come up with a solution that works for everybody.

The final feature will be a collective branch merged after a review from each member.

At the end of Sunday night of class that week, the feature should be complete and the introducion and discussion of the next component should take place.
